# Email Notifier

For when you need scripts to send someone an email instead of merely logging what happens. This library uses Google's Gmail API to send someone an email.

## Set up
1. Get the credentials from rdumas.
2. Run `python quickstart-api.py` to create secrets local to your account/machine
3. Import the `sendmail` function into your code.
