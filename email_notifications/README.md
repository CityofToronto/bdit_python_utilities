# Email Notifier

For when you need scripts to send someone an email instead of merely logging what happens. This library uses Google's Gmail API to send someone an email. Note that the Gmail API does not work behind the corporate firewall.

## Set up
1. Get the credentials from rdumas.
2. Run `python quickstart-api.py` to create secrets local to your account/machine
3. Import the `sendmail` function into your code.
