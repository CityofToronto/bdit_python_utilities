Repeatable Information Charts Kit README
======================================

This module was inspired by charts created for the VFH Bylaw Review Report. There was a need to develop a standardized brand and design language for everything BDITTO produces, so this module aims to produce a regularized set of charts and maps that are consistent with previous charts we create. All of the chart/map producing functions returns a matplotlib fig and ax object so that the figure can be further modified using matplotlib functions.
